# React Integration Test

This page tests the integration of React "Islands" within the Jekyll static site.

<div data-island="HelloGarden" data-props='{ "name": "Gemini Explorer" }'>
  <!-- React will mount here -->
  <p>Loading React component...</p>
</div>

If you see a box with "Hello, Gemini Explorer" above, the integration is successful.

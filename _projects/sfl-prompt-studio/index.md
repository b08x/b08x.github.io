title: SFL Prompt Studio
---

SFL Prompt Studio is designed for practitioners and learners exploring natural language processing (NLP), prompt engineering, and the emerging discipline of context engineering. The project centers on the Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) framework, which structures prompts into three contextual dimensions: Field (what is happening), Tenor (who is taking part), and Mode (the role language is playing). This approach aims to make prompt design more transparent, reproducible, and adaptable across diverse NLP tasks and AI models [source](https://github.com/b08x/sfl-prompt-studio-v2/blob/1462ce05034ddd45ed1ab76d5d5d6b147594e63d/src/services/sflService.ts#L31-L198).
